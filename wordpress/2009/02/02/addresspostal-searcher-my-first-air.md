# Address/Postal Searcher, My First Air Application

Well, I finally did it ! I created a Air Application. The Address Postal Searcher.  
  
It is a ducht application for searching dutch postalcodes and addresses.  
  
  
  
If you like to give it a try and are in need of a dutch postal search appliction or address search application please download it on my [www.vandersluijs.nl](http://www.vandersluijs.nl/index.php/Blog/adrespostcode-zoeker-mijn-eerste-air-applicatie.html) website.  
  
ItÂ’s a little application with a MySQL / PhP backend. You can do up to 5 searches per day. When more you will be redirected to a advertisement page. You can even get a commercial license for my app, then you can do as much searches a day as you need.  
  
If you like to know more about this application, just send me an email !
