# Flex Menu Slide in Slide out Docking

Ever wondered how those nice Menu Screen docks work ? The docks that open when you get close to the edge of your screen ?  
  
Dont look further ! Ive got the Adobe Flex and Air sollution right here !  
  
If you want to make a menu that slides in from top, bottom, left or right Ive got the code for you right here.
