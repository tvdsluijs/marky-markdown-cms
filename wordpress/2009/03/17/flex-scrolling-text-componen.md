# Flex Scrolling Text Component

I needed a Scrolling Text Component to Scroll Text from bottom to top. There are some working ready components for flex on the net. But none of them were what I wanted.  
  
The closest thing that came to my needs was the Peter Ents [Scrolling Text Component](http://weblogs.macromedia.com/pent/archives/2007/12/scrolling_text.html). But.  
  
  
It was not close to what I needed, cause it could only show one line.  
  
The problem was that it was only displaying a Label where I needed a Text (like multiple lines)  
  
So I changed some lines of code, and now it works.  
  
Here you have the one and only Flex Scrolling Text Component with multiple line possiblity.
