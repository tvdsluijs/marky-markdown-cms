# Bye Bye Joomla!, Hello Wordpress

Well, today is a big day for me. I finally moved this site from Joomla! to Wordpress.  
  
Joomla! is a full blown great Content Management System.  
  
It is very strong at many points. It’s professional, has many many plug-ins, is fast, robust and secure.  
  
You probably wonder why.  
  
Well I Will tell you that in this blog.  
  
  
  
So why did you go to Wordpress you may ask.  
  
Because I needed a blog tool, not a CMS.  
  
Again, Joomla! is great, worked with it for many years (first mambo), hell I even sold a lot of components for it.  
  
But, it is just to much for what I need.  
  
I changed to wordpress because….  
  
I want to blog from my phone, without buying a plug-in that doesn’t work for me (mail2joomla, I bought it by the way);  
  
I want good SEF/SEO without installing a buggy (by the way great) plug-in called sh404sef;  
  
I want to be able to blog from a tool like MS Live Writer or W-Bloggar, with all features;  
  
I want to be able to auto upgrade without having to download and ftp upgrade files;  
  
I want to be able to install plug-ins right from my site, without downloading zip files;  
  
I want to be able to Tag;  
  
I want to use good archiving;  
  
Do I have to continue ?  
  
Off course there are some problems when moving from Joomla! to another blog tool. I will tell you about that later.
