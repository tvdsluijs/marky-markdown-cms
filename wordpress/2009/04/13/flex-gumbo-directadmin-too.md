# Flex Gumbo DirectAdmin Tool

I just finished my first real Flex Gumbo Application. It is a tool to change your Email or FTP password when working with a DirectAdmin Environment.  
  
DirectAdmin gave me the tools to use and I have build the Flex Web Application for it.  
  
  
  
You can see a working version [here](http://www.brighthost.eu/directadmin/), but this is only working for my websites. So you will not be able to use it to change your own password.  
  
   


 

  
If you like it and want to use it just [mail](mailto:theo@vandersluijs.nl) me. For private usage you can use it for free. For commercial usage you will pay a small license fee. Just [mail](mailto:theo@vandersluijs.nl) me.  
  
At this moment I have a English and Dutch version. If you like to translate it for your site just let me know and I will give you the translation file.
