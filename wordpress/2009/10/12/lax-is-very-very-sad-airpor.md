# LAX is a very very sad Airport

Well, today I am going home. Almost 10 days of LA (with Adobe MAX at the beginning) and I saw a lot of Los Angeles, San Diego (well only SeaWord) and Santa Monica. Now I am at the Los Angeles International Airport and what I see is so sad !  It’s the Airport that is Sad. 2,5 shops some restaurants and that’s it ! I know Schiphol which is a very big airport but I thought Schiphol would only be a small airport comparing to LAX. I have seen the Series LAX with Heather Locklear and it really looked big ! They don’t even have free WiFi with a connection to the Internet. That is just dumb ! I cannot even send this blog to my Site. Well I really like Schiphol hope to be there soon again !
