# So what else is new, Axiis is !

Yesterday it was another great day at the Adobe Max. Not only did I purchase Adobe Lightroom for a very cheap price compared to Europrean prices ( european price 300 euro, bought it for 178 euro !) but I also saw and learned a lot of great stuff ! Like [Axiis](http://www.axiis.org/) a new way of making charts. Oh yeah you think the charts in Flex are great right ? Well wait till you see the [Axiis](http://www.axiis.org/) charts !  Axiis gives developers the ability to expressively define their data visualizations through concise and intuitive markup. Axiis has been designed with a specific focus on elegant code, where your code can be just as beautiful as your visual output.
