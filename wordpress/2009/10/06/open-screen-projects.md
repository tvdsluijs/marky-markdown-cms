# Open screen projects

Yesterday during the keynotes of the Adobe Max I saw a little more information about the “open screen projects” Kevin Lynch first told more about the upcomming release of flash player 10.1, which will make adobe flex possible on mobile devices (exept iphone). Adobe® Flash® Player 10.1 is the first runtime release of the [Open Screen Project](http://www.openscreenproject.org/) that enables uncompromised Web browsing of expressive applications, content and video across devices. With support for a broad range of mobile devices, including smartphones, netbooks, smartbooks and other Internet-connected devices, Flash Player 10.1 allows your content to reach your customers wherever they are. And then they told more about the Open Screen project. One thing I am certain of, my next phone… will be an [Android](http://www.android.com/) Phone !  Kevin Lynch tells about Flash Player 10.1   10 moblie builder CEO's about the open screen project : The Open Screen Project is an industry-wide initiative, led by Adobe and backed by other industry leaders who all share one clear vision: Enable consumers to engage with rich Internet experiences seamlessly across any device, anywhere.   
Partners in the Open Screen Project are working together to provide a consistent runtime environment for open web browsing and standalone applications — taking advantage of Adobe® Flash® Player and, in the future, Adobe® AIR®. This consistent runtime environment will remove barriers to publishing content and applications across desktops, mobile phones, televisions, and other consumer electronics
