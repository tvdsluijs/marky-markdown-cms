# Sneak Peaks at the Max 2009

It was great, a lot of new stuff. Well just see for your self 

Trust me there was a lot of stuff that really amazed me, like the pause and resume function within Flex (debug, pause, change code, resume debug) But also the photoshop new features where great. But the best thing of all was the Rome Project.
