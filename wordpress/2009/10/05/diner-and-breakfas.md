# Diner and Breakfast

A colleague of mine was worrying about me and my colleagues here eating enough.  
  
As very body knows the big portions you get in America he was worried after seeing the small portions I had the last couple of days.  
  
Last night we ate at the [Daily Grill](http://dailygrill.com/details.php?loid=12). We weren’t very hungry so we ordered The Childs meals.  
  
   
  
  
  
   
  
This morging we had breakfast at [Denny’s](http://www.dennys.com/en/) , the breakfast in the hotel is how we call it in Dutch “Ranzig” or not very nice.  
  
So yesterday we were walking around in LA and we saw 4 cops eating, so we were thinking… that place has to be good !  
  
And it was !
