# Adobe Max, Last day

So what have I seen and learned so far ? Well let’s first talk a bit more about the last day at the Adobe Max converence. Yep, it was great again ! I have seen stuff that you would like to have right away. Great new Flex features. The AFCS Collaboration in the Cloud system (which are great if you want to write great collaboration tools) I have seen that Flex Builder…. oh oh… I mean Flash Builder is not due to arrive at your desktop Q1 2010. I also learned that is is really really very easy to create a PhP datadriven Flex App. But….. wait there is more !  Yes, which I could tell you right here or you can go see for yourself on the Adobe site ! Right here : <http://max.adobe.com/online/?sid=EUSBQ>
