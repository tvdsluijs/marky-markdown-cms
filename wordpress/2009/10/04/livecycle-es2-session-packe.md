# LiveCycle ES2 Session Packet

Almost 80 attendees at the “LiveCycle ES2, Building Rich, Engaging Applications”  Session, that’s a lot of people.  
  
What I learned so far is great. I really like to show this to my collegue Martin G. (aka Gerrit)  
  
I think he will be surprices about what LiveCycle ES can do.
