# Donations for this iMac 24-inch

So what do I really want ? As you know I am trying to get enough money to get a iMac.  
  
But what iMac do I really really want.  
  
Well I like to think big so I would go for the 24-inch version of the iMac and   
  
  
  
Well this would be the exact configuration:  
  
3.06GHz Intel Core 2 Duo  
4GB 800MHz DDR2 SDRAM - 2x2GB  
750GB Serial ATA Drive  
NVIDIA GeForce 8800 GS w/512MB GDDR3  
Apple Mighty Mouse  
Apple Keyboard
