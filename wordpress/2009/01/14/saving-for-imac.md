# Saving for an iMac

A collegue of mine has a Mac, a Macbook to be precise.  
  
Everything he is telling me about it reminds me of Linux / Ubuntu.  
  
Everything he is telling me about the Macbook I like very much.  
  
At home I need a new PC, but Why not buy an iMac I thought.  
  
Well first of all, it is expensive.  
  
Off course if you look at what you get for the money its a bargan, but it is still expensive.  
  
But after seeing all that great stuff you can do with a Mac, I really really really want one.  
  
I dont need it today, so I am going to start a Donation programm for it.  
  
  
  
If you like my site, and I am sure you do, I am asking you to donate 1 dollar.  
  
1 single dollar, so I only need 2400 people to come to my site and donate.  
  
You would say that is easy right ?  
  
I hope so, I am hoping to buy the Mac by the end of March.  
  
   
  
So please help, and donate 1 dollar.  
  
You can find the donation button on the right side of this screen. Scroll a bit down if you cannot see it.  
  
   
  
Thanxs!
