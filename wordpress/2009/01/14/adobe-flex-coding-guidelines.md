# Adobe Flex Coding Guidelines

Fabio Terracini of [Dclick](http://blog.dclick.com.br/) has released a document about Flex (MXML and ActionScript) coding conventions that he uses on a regular basis. His objective: provide a common and consistent language to help code comprehension between developers.  
  
  
Unfortunately the document is out of date. it is almost over 2 years old and no updates have been done since February 2007.  
The document can still be found [here](http://blog.dclick.com.br/wp-content/uploads/adobe-flex-coding-guidelines-v12-english.pdf).  
But some stuff is like I said outdated. Like the link to the Creating ASDoc Comments from the Adobe site. You can find that infomation [here](http://livedocs.adobe.com/flex/3/html/help.html?content=asdoc_3.html).  
Another good web page to start with when you need coding guidelines is the [Adobe Open Source Flex SDK Coding Conventions page](http://opensource.adobe.com/wiki/display/flexsdk/Coding+Conventions).  
There is also a good deal of information on [Developer Documentation](http://opensource.adobe.com/wiki/display/flexsdk/Developer+Documentation) on the Adobe Open Source site .
