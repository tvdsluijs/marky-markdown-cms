# Back to X4ALL

Finally ! a few more days and I am back on the old internet providers Nest. Finally back at XS4ALL.  
  
A few years back I had to leave them because they where not providing a good VOIP sollution.  
  
  
  
But as from the 13th of January I will have my XS4ALL ADSL connection with VOIP this time.  
  
Off course I will have to configure my Fritzbox Fon WLAN 710 router and put some voip information in it but I will do that before the 13th I think.  
  
At this time my internet provider named telfort just suckes big time. Internet is okay but I can not make a phonecall.
