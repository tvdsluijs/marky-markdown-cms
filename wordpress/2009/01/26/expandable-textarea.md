# Expandable Textarea

Would it not be nice to have a small Textarea which would get bigger when you go in to it.  
  
At the project working for NL for Business at the Financial Insurance / Banking Company we had a problem. I say we because my collegue (Mark Huisman) actually solved this problem.  
  
We had so many fields on one tab the page was just to big if we made all text areaÂ’s big enough to display a big amount of text.  
  
But we found a sollution for this.  
  
  
  
The magic word is Auto Expandable Texarea. The Text Area looks small in the beginning, but when you jump in to it it auto expands to a bigger one. And when you jump out it just gets small again.  
  
  
  
Click right to steal the code ;-)  
  
With special thanxs to Mark Huisman.
