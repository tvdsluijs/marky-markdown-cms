# iMac Donation update

Until now it is going very well with the donations for my iMac. I started this  Donations for an iMac 8 days ago and until now I have gotten a nice amount of donations. The exact amount is    
  
. 204,= euros ! So far so good. But off course this happend because a lot of friends, some colleques and a family member donated for my iMac. So what I now need is the Donation of the visitors of this site. So I need the Donation from you. If you would like to know why I am trying to get donations for my iMac, please look [here](http://www.iamboredsoiblog.eu/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=120:saving-for-an-imac&catid=58:general&Itemid=7). ![](https://www.paypal.com/nl_NL/i/scr/pixel.gif)
