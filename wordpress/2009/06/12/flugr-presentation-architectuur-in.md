# Flugr Presentation "Flex Architectuur in an enterprise landschap" online

Last wednesday (10 juni) I did a presentation for [Flugr](http://www.flugr.nl/) “Flex Architectuur in een enterprise landschap”. In this presentation I told more about SAP and Adobe Flex within big organisations. About how SAP and Adobe Flex can be used togehter. What connection possibilities there are and which to use. I also tell more about a project where SAP and Adobe Flex were used to replace a MS Access application. The problems we had and how we solved them. The presentation is online (sorry dutch only) : <http://emea53029464.emea.acrobat.com/p48533551/>
