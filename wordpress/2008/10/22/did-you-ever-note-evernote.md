# Did you ever note, Evernote ?

An ex collegue of mine told me a few months ago to start using [Evernote](http://www.evernote.com/). He said it was the best piece of software he had ever seen in the last couple of years.  
  
Well.. to be honest...Â  I downloaded it... installed it... looked at it... and removed it.  
  
But I have it back on my pc again....  
  
  
  
You must be wondering why. Well I will tell you in a sec. Let me first tell you what [Evernote](http://www.evernote.com/) is. I call it the remember everything application.  
  
Or how [Evernote](http://www.evernote.com/) self descripes it : Evernote allows you to easily **capture** information in any environment using whatever device or platform you find most convenient, and makes this information **accessible** and **searchable** at any time, from anywhere.  
  
Well... but why am I using it. Well that one is very easy. I was always emailing stuff to my own email account to not forget anything. Like an URL I wanted to remember... or an new email address from a friend.. or even that I had an appointment. But also big pieces of text and images. It all cluttered up my mailbox.  
  
But since I have [Evernote](http://www.evernote.com/) on all my pc's, mobile phones etc I never forget a single item.  
  
Well there is actually not more to tell, you just have to start using it yourself. Or just take a look at their Tour.
