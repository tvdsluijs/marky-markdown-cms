# OMG what have I done

Don't worry.... it is nothing serious.  
This morning I told you I was going dutch right ... (no no not getting cheap here).  
But I did not realize how much work that would be. I had to translate every menu item, every category, section... pfffff need I go in.  
Do you have any idea how much category's I had... yes had... deleted half of them to speed things up.  
Well, but.... success... finally it is done... I hope I am happy with this now... for I really want to start blogging now.  
Like about the new Tamrom lens 18-270 I received yesterdan.
