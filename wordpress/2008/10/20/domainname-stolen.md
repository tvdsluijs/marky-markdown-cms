# Domainname stolen

Well... let me tell you a story about the stolen domain name.  
  
At first I wanted to blog on the domain-name www.iamboredsoiblog.com.... last week 17 October, I googled and searched if this domain-name was free.... and it was !  
  
I asked my hosting provider (Altijdup2date.nl which I am reselling for) to claim this domain-name immediately. And so he did.... I think .... ?  
  
But......   
  
  
They probably did NOT ! The ASSES. I kept waiting... and waiting for my domain to come online.... but nothing... and than suddenly..... a kind of search site was in place of where my site should be !  
  
I looked up the whois and what do you think ? A spam company registered the domainname on 18 October, WTF ?????  
  
So I mailed my hosting provider... (the asses, altijdup2date) for some explination...... NO Answer ! But off course.....  
  
I pulled back my two domain-name registrations (I also wanted www.imboredsoiblog.com) and did this with a real pissed off attitude... (man I was pissed). It is not that my hosting provider (the asses, altijdup2date.nl) did not claim the domain name right away, but also that another company, (I buy all domain-names.com) claimed the domain-name the next DAY !!!!  
  
So.... away with my hosting provider (the ass, altijdup2date.nl) I searched the net and surfed to.. www.one.com.  
  
For just 1,50 euro I choose a package and claimed www.iamboredsoiblog.eu.... and within 2 days, (it was weekend when I ordered it) I had my domain, with mysql and php and everything.....
