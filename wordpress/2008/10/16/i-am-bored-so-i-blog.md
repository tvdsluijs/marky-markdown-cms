# I am Bored So I Blog

So.... am I really bored ?  
  
No offcourse not, but talking to a collegue ([The Muth](http://www.themuth.com/)) the other day at SAP Teched 2008 we discussed blogger.  
  
He said that bloggers have to much time on their hands.... but I have been blogging since.... since.... well since a very long time.  
  
And I am not bored... not at all, I blog so I can tell my thoughts, my doings and my great adventures in the big big world to you.  
  
Some people however really blog like everything.... they use web apps like [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/). (what I also use) . Those people, not like me blog like every 5 minutes. Great but that is a thing I really can not do... no time for that... so back to the bored statement.  
  
Are those people bored ... or do they just have to much time on their hands ? Talking about this to my Collegue [The Muth](http://www.themuth.com/), he thought up a really great internet name..... I am Bored So I Blog.  
  
So... am I bored ..... No but I really liked the name... and as from today I will blog on this site. (and not on my "old"  site, [www.vandersluijs.nl](http://www.vandersluijs.nl/))
