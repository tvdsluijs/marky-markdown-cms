# Sap Teched 2008 Boring keynote

Well, today I had to wake up at 5 AM to go to the SAP Teched 2008 Keynote. It is a big presentation about SAP, where they are now, where they will be tomorrow, and where they want to go in the future.  
  
There where 2... No 3 speakers... Or just 2. Well as you can see, I did not really paid attention.  
  
The keynote was named :  
[Connect. Collaborate. Co-Innovate.](http://www.sapteched.com/emea/activities/keynotes.htm)  
  
The main speaker was LÃ©o Apotheker, co-CEO of SAP AG. Well he really really really was boring. He probably is a great CEO, but his way of presenting keynotes are deadly ;-) ha ha ha .. only the beginning was good, it was a story about a Balloon. It was a kind of joke to show the differences between people working in business and development.  


> A man in a hot air balloon is lost. He sees a man on the ground and reduces height to speak to him.

  
"Excuse me, can you tell me where I am?"  
  
"You're in a hot air balloon hovering thirty feet above this field," comes the reply.  
  
"You must work in Information Technology," says the balloonist.  
  
"I do," says the man, "How did you know?"  
  
"Well," says the balloonist, "Everything you told me is technically correct, but it's no use to anyone."  
  
"You must be in business," says the man.  
  
"I am," says the balloonist, "How did you know?"  
"Well," says the man, "You don't know where you are, you don't know where you're going, but you expect me to be able to help. You're in the same position you were before we met, but now it's my fault."  
  
Unfortunately it was not his own made up joke. I think he got it from [this site](http://blogs.msdn.com/somasegar/archive/2006/11/20/what-i-learn-from-a-hot-air-balloon-story.aspx).  
  
Don't get me wrong, the presentation was good, but it was boring. Only thing that made it a bit less boring was a co-presentator that showed some great SAP demo's.
