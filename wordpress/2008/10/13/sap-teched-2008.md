# Sap Teched 2008

This week the SAP Teched 2008 started. I have written a little bit about this on my "old" blog, [www.vandersluijs.nl](http://www.vandersluijs.nl/) but I wanted to tell you a bit more and show you some photos.  
  
Me and my collegues from [NL4B](http://www.nl4b.com/) had a room in the HotelOne Hotel in Berlin. I think this is one of the best business hotels I have ever seen. It was a new, clean hotel with a pop art touch. My room wasn't very big but big enough to spend the night.  
  
The room had a fresh look, with lot's of blue (you see this blue color everywhere in the hotel) and the shower was great. It was more like a warm waterfall.  
  
But the best off all was my digital fireplace (flatscreen TV, with dvd of fireplace in it.)  
  
I also had a great view.... well actually not really great, but if I looked to the side I saw the big [FernsehnTurm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernsehturm).
