# Removing Security Pop ups in Vista

Well Vista.... cannot stop talking about it. This time I want to tell something about the security popus vista displays. At microsoft they call it UAC, User Account Control. I call it..... AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH.... where is the pop-up killer for this !  Well... I found it ! I googled and found this URL [http://www.petri.co.il/disable_uac_in_windows_vista.htm](http://www.petri.co.il/disable_uac_in_windows_vista.htm) The easiest sollution is doing the Control Panel sollution. They also have a small movie how to do it !
