# The Chronicles of Spellborn Beta Tester

Yesterday I got a mail from [The Chronicles of Spellborn](http://www.tcos.com/) Development Team.  
  
I applied for beta tester for the Chronicles of Spellborn game . and I got the job.  
  
As from today I can go and play and test this great game.  
  
I played a lot of World of Warcraft so my hopes are high for this game.  
  
   
  
  
  
   
  
**What is Chronicles of Spellborn ?**  
  
TCoS is a MMORPG, developed by Spellborn International and distributed by Frogster Interactive, set in a post-apocalyptic fantasy world. Spellborn uses the Unreal Engine, featuring a so-called European Art approach and contains notable contributions from Jesper Kyd.  
  
Spellborn distinguishes itself from other MMORPGs by emphasizing the focus on story line, separating the look and the statistics of gear, integrating PvE (Player vs Environment) and PvP (Player vs Player) and offering combat that is fast paced and more reliant on player skill.  
  
Spellborn consists largely of conventional MMORPG gameplay, in which the player plays a character (his avatar), and explores the gameworld in order to gain experience points and advance in level. In exploring the gameworld, he encounters quests, the most important part of Spellborn's gameplay. The game has about a thousand of these quests. Completing quests is the primary means of earning experience points. Repeatedly killing creatures ("Grinding" in gaming jargon) to gain levels is not a practical option in Spellborn. Separate from other story-driven quests are the Ancestral Quests, which allow the player to take the role of a major character in Spellborn's history to accomplish a specific requirement. Players need to complete certain Ancestral Quests in order to advance their character's story arc.  
  
Spellborn incorporates a first person targeting system. In this system, the player selects an available skill to use, while aiming at the opponent. The player can also use two skills at the same time to create combinations.
