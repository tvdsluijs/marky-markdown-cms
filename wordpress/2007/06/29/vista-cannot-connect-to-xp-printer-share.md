# Vista cannot connect to XP printer share

Well.... Vista... I have it on my new Dell pc.   
It looks great, but Windows ME also looked great.   
  
Windows Vista like Windows ME is far from a workable product.   
  
Like connection to my XP Shared printer. It just doesn't work !   
  
Yesterday I found a great workaround for this not solved Microsoft Windows problem.   
  
But what was my problem exactly ?   
  
I wanted to use my Windows XP shared printer (HP Laserjet 6L).   
So I tried adding a new network printer.   
I found it, I can see the properties.... but I cannot connect.   
On my Windows XP machine, it says that everyone can use this shared printer.   
Hell, even my Ubuntu laptop prints on this printer   
  
But... Vista thinks it cannot ! It just refused to connect !   
  
So.. the sollution =============================================   
_Go to Control Panel. Choose printer. Then choose Add Printer.   
  
Choose Add a local printer. Click on Create a new port. The default in the drop down box is Local Port. Do not change that. Click Next.   
  
A dialogue box will appear asking for you to enter a port name. Type in the computernameprintername ie. My computer's name is "DeepSpaceNine" and the printer name is HPLaser6L so I typed in DeepSpaceNineHPLaser6L   
  
Now... press cancel. (yes press cancel !)   
  
Choose Add a local printer (what ... again ? Yes again.. I told you this is a great workaround)   
  
Press Next choose your just created new port.   
Choose your printer from the list._   
============================================= And Voila .... it works   
  
Ain't Vista great !
