# I hate Microsoft Vista !!!!!

I really ... really ... really hate Vista !! I get Errors !! I have Driver problems !!! (logitech webcam won't work very well) I have Hardware Problems (my pc is brand new) I have Software problems !! I have XP SHared printer connection problems !! I have Software crashes... and even Vista crashes ! And most of all... I have Internet Problems... It is slow.... so ... so .... very ..... very slow... and offcourse I get connection errors. But wait ... there is more... not only the connection on my Vista pc is slow... no ... it just slows down my whole network.... so my wife is not very happy about that....Â  So today... I am going to unplug this piece of CRAP ! and install Ubuntu on my pc.
