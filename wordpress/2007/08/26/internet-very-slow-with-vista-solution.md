# Internet very slow with Vista, Solution !!!

It drove me nuts !!............. VISTA !!!!!!! om My Dell Dimension 9200 Problems, errors, crashes .... but most of all ... very slow internet connection. (with timeouts and connection errors) The strange thing was.... it was on all my pc's... even pc's with Ubuntu or Windows XP installed. When I shut down the Vista PC.... internet was very fast on all other machines !   
  
In the meanwhile, I could install Vista with my eyes wide shut (know the movie  ) . I did it so many times ....  ..... instaling Vista I mean... but without any success. I though it was some third party software which made my internet slow.  Now I have got dual boot.... Ubuntu and Vista.... surfing the net with Ubuntu..... the rest... Vista. But why.... why is this problem bothering me.... I could not stop thinking about it. On many sites .... there al different sollutions . Like : 

  * Stop the  Qos service 
  * Stop the ipv6 functionality 
  * Stop the  phlishing filter 
  * Uninstall Mcaffee 
  * Do a  "**netsh interface tcp set global autotuning=disabled"** in a CMDbox  
Wanna read more about this ? ?? [Here,](http://www.ads-links.com/index.php/how-to-fix-windows-vista-slow-network-transfer.html) [here](http://forums.techguy.org/windows-vista/582344-solved-slow-internet-connection-vista-4.html) and [here.](http://robgarrett.com/cs/blogs/software/archive/2006/12/31/vista-firefox-2-slow-network.aspx)  It did not help any shit ! Then.... I found a posting on a forum about a guy who had uninstalled a Windows Vista patch (KB929735) and after this uninstallment... his internet was up and running again ... No... would this be......... Nope.... it did not help. But then ... I found the following posting [following posting](http://forums.tomcoyote.org/Pcs_Slow_Internet_Connection_After_Microsoft_Updates_t82492.html) _I have 1 desktop and 2 laptops which are all suddenly working slowly after downloading windows pdates after I returned from holiday. The PC and 1 laptop is running XP and 1 laptop is running Vista. I would appreciate help on the dektop initially. Thanks._ And then I saw the light...... I found the solution !!!!! It always looked like Internet was fast after a fresh install of Vista !... But after a few restarts it got slower and slower ..... So... I uninstalled all Microsoft Vista patches..... stoped the automatic updater, and refused the connection to the windows updates server   
And......... after one restart...... internet is super fast again ! No more updates for some time for me !
