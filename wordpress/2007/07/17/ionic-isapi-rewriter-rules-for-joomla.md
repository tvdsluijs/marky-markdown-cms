# Ionic Isapi Rewriter rules for Joomla!

IIRF or Ionic Isapi is a small, cheap, easy to use, URL rewriting ISAPI filter that combines a good price (free!) with good features. It is reasonably fast, and reasonably powerful.  
  
But for Joomla! users who want to use SEF, it can be a pain in the ass.  
  
I figured out how to use it with Joomla! and with 90% of the top rated components.  
  
You can use my file for free.Â    
  
Don't know what Ionic Isapi Rewriter is ? Look on the [IIRF site](http://cheeso.members.winisp.net/IIRF.aspx). [Download the file here.](http://www.vandersluijs.nl/images/stories/files/isapirewrite4.zip) 2007-07-17 11:41:09
