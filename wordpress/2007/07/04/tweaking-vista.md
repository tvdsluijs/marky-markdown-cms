# Tweaking Vista

The last view days I was wondering why my harddisks kept doing something when using Windows Vista. When I visited some sites I found out that Windows Vista does a lot of things to keep itself fast.  Like auto defrag my harddisk, indexing al files to speed up searching and prefetching. (a way to extend the virtual memory)   
  
I don't think that my harddisk likes this very mucht, I wonder if my harddisks life will shorten because of this. On many sites it says that leaving your pc on for a night will solve this problem. (Vista then will be ready indexing en prefetching e.g.) So I did... and it did not help. I think these 3 "services" are running in a visual circle. Vista defrags my Harddisk, Vista renews the file index and creates a new prefetch, and Vista defrags again...... Never ending story   
  
So.......   
  
I want to stop these services   
  
Vista has everything well hidden. So  I searched the internet again and found  [Vispa](http://vispa.whyeye.org/) . (Found on [InsideMicrosoft ](http://microsoft.blognewschannel.com/archives/2007/06/21/a-ton-of-options-for-tweaking-vista/)blog)
