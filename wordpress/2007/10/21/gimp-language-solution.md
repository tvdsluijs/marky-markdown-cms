# Gimp language solution

There are a lot of people that have a language problem,,, in GIMP  
  
They would like to have GIMP in English, but the see German.  
  
Or... they like GIMP in German... but they see it in English.  
  
If you search in Google for  "GIMP Language problem" you get 2.1 milion pages, without the correct solution.  
  
If you search in Google for  "GIMP change language"  you get 1.9 milion pages, without the correct solution.  
  
  
  
There are two global solutions on the internet.  
  
1\. Change the language preferences of windows  
  
2\. Remove all languages from GIMP except the language you want to see.  
  
I can say only this..................... WRONG !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  
  
People... it is this simple  
  
1\. Close GIMP (if you have it open)  
  
2\. Go to (in windows XP) ->start -> All Programs -> GTK+ Runtime Environment -> Select Language  
  
3\. You will see the following screen. Adjust the Current User's Language to the language you want.  
  
    
  
Click OK !... READY !
