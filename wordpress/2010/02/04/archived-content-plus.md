# Archived Content Plus

![Archived_Content_Plus](http://www.iamboredsoiblog.eu/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Archived_Content_Plus_thumb.png)This new version of the Archived Content Plus for Joomla 1.5 has a lot of bugfixes and a new javascript core.  
  
  
  
The accordion menu is smoother and works better.  
  
  
If you want to show your archives the Wordpress style on your Joomla! 1.5 / 1.6 / 1.7 / 2.5 site. This is the Module to start using.  
  
Wanna see a [demo ?](http://demos.gebruikmaar.nl/joomla/index.php/extensions/modules/archived-content-plus.html)  


> There is a Major Joomla! 1.5 bug in where you cannot use SEF when opening a Archive URL. The URL to the Archive list is wrong. Joomla! did not solve this problem yet. (bug tracker : <http://snurl.eu/pxbwp>)  
  
If you want the module see working go to the [archives menu item](http://www.blogger.com/index.php/archives.html) (some how joomla does the right SEF thing there))

**Joomla! 1.5 / 1.6 / 1.7 / 2.5 ready!**  
  
Please pick the right version for your Joomla! version !  
  
You can download [sourcecode](https://github.com/tvdsluijs/Joomla-Archive-Plus/) here on github.
