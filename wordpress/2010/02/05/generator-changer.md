# Generator Changer

Don't like the way Joomla! puts its name in your site by using the generator meta tag ?  
  
There is no way you can change this in the global configuration and when displaying the source code of your site you will always see .  
  
With this plugin you can change it to what ever you wish ! Or even leave it empty.  
  
This is important if you don't want search engines picking up your site with Joomla meta tags. Especially if your site doesn't have anything to do with Joomla!  
  
See the source code (right mouse click -> source) our demo siteÂ <http://demos.gebruikmaar.nl/joomla/> to see what it puts into the source code.  
  
Hint, look for the following line:  
  
_name="generator" content="Build by Theo" />_  
  
Then change the template to another one and you will see that the code stays intact.  
  
_**Joomla! 1.5 , 1.6, 1.7 and 2.5 ready!**_  
  
Well... you can find the sources on [Github](https://github.com/tvdsluijs/Remove-Joomla-Generator-MetaKey/tree/)  
  
Like my code ? Don't forget to
