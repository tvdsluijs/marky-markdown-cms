# Section Category List

The section category list is a kind of menu list where all your sections and categories are in.  
  
You can open and collapse them by pressing the Plus Sign.  
  
When clicking on a Section or Category link you will go to that section or category and the page will show all articles in that section or category.  
  
You can see a demo [here.](http://demos.gebruikmaar.nl/joomla/index.php/extensions/modules/section-category-list.html)  


> There is a Major Joomla! 1.5 bug in where you cannot use SEF when opening a content section or category URLs. The URL to the Section and/or category list is wrong. Joomla! did not solve this problem yet. (bug tracker :<http://snurl.eu/pxbwp>)

  
**Sorry this code is broken. I hope to get it back online soon!**
