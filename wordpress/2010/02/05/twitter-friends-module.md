# Twitter Friends Module

With this little module you can show pictures (avatars) of People that YOU are following  on Twitter.

  
You can set the number of avatars you want to show and how big the pictures should be.  
  
You can even set caching on or off so the module will not get the people you are following every view.  


Your twitter friends will show up in a random order. So by showing 10 friends it does not mean your site visitor will see the same friends every time they visit your site.

  


And do you know what the best thing is about this Joomla! module ? It will only cost you 1,50 euro (± 2 US dollar) for the download and then you can use it on every site you have.

  


You can see a demo [here](http://demos.gebruikmaar.nl/joomla/index.php/extensions/modules/twitter-friends.html).
