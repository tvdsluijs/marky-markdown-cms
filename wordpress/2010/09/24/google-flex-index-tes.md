# Google Flex index test

I wanted to see if google would actually index this page and if google will index the text inside the flex app shown below.  
So this somewhat strange app with strange words in it, should be searched for within a day from google search.  
If this actually is searchable you will be able to write non-scrapable websites.  
  
Next step will be to change the text/data within the flex app every day and see if google picks that up.  
But for now, this simple testâ€¦.  
  
  
  


  
  
To view this page ensure that Adobe Flash Player version  
10.0.0 or greater is installed.  
  
  


  
  
  
  
  
  
Either scripts and active content are not permitted to run or Adobe Flash Player version  
10.0.0 or greater is not installed.

Update: After exactly 1 minute google could find this page by searching on the title of this page :   
[http://www.google.nl/search?sourceid=chrome&ie;=UTF-8&q;=Google+Flex+index+test](http://www.google.nl/search?sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=Google+Flex+index+test)  
But, it cannot find the words within the flex app yet.
