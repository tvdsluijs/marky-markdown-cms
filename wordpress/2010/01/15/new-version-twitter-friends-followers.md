# New Version Twitter Friends & Followers

Thanxs to the testing of Paul Cornelissen of [Screenbizz design studio](http://www.screenbizz.nl/) I could remove quite an annoying bug in the [Joomla! Twitter Friends](http://www.iamboredsoiblog.eu/2009/12/14/twitter-friends-module-for-joomla/) and [Joomla! Twitter Followers](http://www.iamboredsoiblog.eu/2009/12/14/twitter-followers-module-for-joomla/) modules. Due to server restrictions some people had error messages or white screens at the Joomla! page. If you just bought one of these two modules (this month / january 2010) just send me an email and I will give you one free download so you will have the latest version. You can now also change the look of your module by changing the css file in the modules tmpl folder.

Oh, and just so you know…judging us all based on a few is the definition of this racism you accuse us all of. Granted your judgement is based on spoken word, not skin color, but the concept is the same. So, good job!
