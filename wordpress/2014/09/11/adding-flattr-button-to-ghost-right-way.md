# Adding a Flattr button to Ghost, the right way

So you want to add a Flattr button to Ghost?  
  
You've read this post [Adding a Flattr button to Ghost](http://whird.jpope.org/adding-a-flattr-button-to-a-ghost-blog/) by Jeremy Pope but it just doesn't work?  
  
I had the same problem!  
  
But here's how you can make it work!   
  


### The Wrong Way

  
  
There's nothing really wrong with [Jeremy Pope](http://whird.jpope.org/adding-a-flattr-button-to-a-ghost-blog/) way. I guess the post is just old and the Ghost code changed.  
  
I had all kinds of problems with this way of implementing it.  
  


### The Right Way

  
  
But actually it's very easy to implement a Flattr button in your page  
  
You really don't need to know a lot of coding.  
  
Just open up the file "post.hbs" in a notepad/texteditor and and put the following lines of code wherever you want the button to show up!  
  
  
  
**Now, don't forget to make your changes!!**  
  
In this code change YOURFLATTRUSERNAME (user_id=) to your own username  
  
And change language to your own language code, mine is _language=nl_NL_  
  
nl_NL is for Dutch, The Netherlands   
  
en_GB is for English, Great Britain   
  
en_US is for English, US  
  
That's it!  
  
Save the file, zip the theme and upload it to your ghost CMS!  
  
And don't forget to flattr this post :-)  
  
Did you know you can host your own Ghost blog on your own [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=38909179d2dc) server?
