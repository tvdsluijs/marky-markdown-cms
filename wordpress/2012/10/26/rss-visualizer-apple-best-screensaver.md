# RSS Visualizer, Apple's best screensaver on a Mac

![](/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/RSS-Visualizer-300x214.jpg) The Mac Lion OS  had a beautiful screensaver that allowed you to easily and simply display RSS feeds on your screen. Unfortunately, Apple decided to remove this beautiful screensaver from Mountain Lion . You want it back? Mountain Lion has brought many improvements in the Mac OS. The various improvements do have one disadvantage they removed the RSS Visualizer screen saver. This screensaver showed RSS feeds in a very unusual but beautiful way. In mountain lion, the screensaver RSS Visualizer is just gone! But wait!  I got it for you! Just unpack, and then drop here: 

> /System/Library/Screen Savers/

 

After putting it on the right place you can start using the screensaver again!
