# Yeah!!! I'm a certified Pomodoro Master

![](/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/pomodoro-master.png)

Well I could not believe it at first, but my colleague [Harrie Verveer](http://www.harrieverveer.nl/) was right. I'm a certified Pomodoro Master.  
  
It has been quite a few months since I wrote the 6 objectives of the technique and send it to the [Pomodoro Technique®](http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/) site.  
  
I was looking for my own page on the Pomodoro World’s Citizens Registry, but I could not find it.  
  
I was looking for it on the [citizens-registry](http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/citizens-registry/) page. But that did not change!  
  
Guess what, it seems I was looking on the wrong page. Don't know what the [citizens-registry](http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/citizens-registry/) page is for, but my page on Pomodoro can be found by going to the "[Experiences](http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/experiences/)" page. And there it is !

So now, I'll have to write an abstract for a talk for the [Dutch PHP Conference 2013](http://www.phpconference.nl/). As I promised to Harrie :-)
