# Fringe season finale is totally WRONG!!!

The last Fringe season is not a very good season!  
  
Don't get me wrong! I love Fringe... no let me correct that. I loved Fringe.  


> _**Fringe**_ is an American [science fiction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction) television series created by [J. J. Abrams](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._J._Abrams), [Alex Kurtzman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Kurtzman), and [Roberto Orci](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_Orci). It premiered on the[Fox Broadcasting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company) network on September 9, 2008, and concluded on January 18, 2013, after five seasons and 100 episodes. The series follows [Olivia Dunham](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivia_Dunham) ([Anna Torv](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Torv)), [Peter Bishop](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Bishop) ([Joshua Jackson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Jackson)), and [Walter Bishop](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Bishop_\(Fringe\)) ([John Noble](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Noble)), members of a [Federal Bureau of Investigation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation) "Fringe Division" team based in [Boston](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston), [Massachusetts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts) under the supervision of [Homeland Security](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Homeland_Security). The team uses ["fringe" science](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fringe_science) and FBI investigative techniques to investigate a series of unexplained, often ghastly occurrences, which are related to mysteries surrounding a [parallel universe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_universe_\(fiction\)). The series has been described as a hybrid of _[The X-Files](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_X-Files)_, _[Altered States](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altered_States)_, and_[The Twilight Zone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Twilight_Zone_\(1959_TV_series\))_.

  
Last week I saw the season finally of the last season, and it was WRONG !!!! So very WRONG!!!!  
  
Thruout the seasons every episode was very good. There was not a thing that could not be explained by Peter or Walter Bishop.  
  
But in this final season, everything went wrong!!!  
  
**If you read any further, you will get some spoilers so... if you have not seen this final Fringe Season don't read on!**  
  
So... do you know about the grandfather time travel paradox? So let's say you could actually time travel. And you would go back to the time your grandfather lived in? And you make a small mistake in that time period and your grandfather never meets your grandmother. So then your father would never be born (as he would be somebody else) and you will never be born!  
  
At that point you would not be able to travel back in time and make that mistake where your grandfather never meets your grandmother... and now, because that mistake was never made, your grandfather will meet your grandmother, and your father will be born, and you will be born. Now that you are born, you will travel back to your grandfathers time, making the same mistake again, you will not be born, the mistake will never be made... yada yada yada.  
  
I guess you understands what is happening, a infinite loop that will destroy the universe (they think)  
  
Now all that stuff was not right in Fringe.  
  
When sending the observer child to the future with Walter Bishop, Walter Bishop was erased from our timeline.  
Not being in our timeline, he would never be able to get Peter Bishop from the other dimension (as his own child died)  
  
Not getting Peter from the other time line means that Peter and Olivia will never send the child to the future. So Walter is still here, he will get Peter from the other dimension... yada yada yada..  
  
Now for another paradox!  
  
By sending the child observer to the future, the observers as we know would never have exist! So, the observer called September would never had exists! So, when Walter got Peter from the other dimension on the frozen lake, Peter would have drowned if September would not have saved him. But September did not exist so Peter drowns! When Peter drowns he will never help destroy the observers as we know them, so the observers stay, and September lives. And September will save Peter. Peter will now send the boy into the future, destroying the observers.... guess what happens!  
  
Let's say Peter would drown in the lake, than he will never meet Olivia, and their daughter will never be born. But peter was saved and he will meet Olivia... is your head hurting yet?  
  
Without the observers the observer boy also would never have existed... so what will we send to the future then?  
  
There are even more paradoxes with Olivia, and their daughter. It's just not right!  
  
I know it's not easy to not time travel and get these paradoxes, but this Fringe season was just very WRONG!!!!  
  
I guess it would have been beter if the observers would still be there but a lot nicer after they send the boy to the future. So September would still go back in time to save Peter.  
  
Well, I guess it's not easy to write a good script without time paradox errors.
