# So you're back, from outer space.

Yes, the blog is back!  
  
A few weeks ago I had to close my blog because of some legal rights problems. Since the beginning of internet I have been blogging and using images from the net.  
  
A few weeks ago some lawyers came knocking at some of my friends doors to get money for their clients. Because they used their images / photos.  
  
At first I closed my blogÂ for eternity, but a lot of visitors complaint that they could not find my blog and my articles.  
  
So... I removed all images / photos that were not mine from the posts.  
  
And now I'm back ! (from outer space!)  
  
Enjoy!
