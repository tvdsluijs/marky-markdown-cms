# #Adobe Max 2011 Trip? (english version)

Yesterday @adobesystemsnl twittered this post:  


> Registration for MAX is opened (Los Angeles, 1-5 October)! Early bird discount until 31 July. <http://max.adobe.com/>

  
I remember thinking ... DAMN!!!!, I'd like to go. That could also happen were it not that I had to buy a car.  
  
bye bye 3000 euros .... for the Adobe Max 2011!  
  
  
  
So I thought ... you know what I retweet the message that I simply can not go because of the car I had to buy.  


> @AdobeSystemsNL Damn. Would like to go there but unfortunately I had to buy a car (Bye Bye #Adobe #MAX money!) sponsor me please, anyone?

  
As a joke I put in "Please sponsor me, Anyone?".  
  
And what did @ adobesystemsnl then?  
  
@adobesystemsnl retweeted my message to 1743 followers! I wonder if there is a sponsor at the look out for me.
