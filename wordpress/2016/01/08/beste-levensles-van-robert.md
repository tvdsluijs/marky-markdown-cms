> Listen, smile, agree, and then do whatever the fuck you were gonna do anyway

_By Robert Downey Jr._

**[Sunday](#64 "2016-01-09 16:21:53"):** RDJ did say this during the "Inside The Actors Studio" episode of July 9th 2006. Do watch it, its a great show. He however repeated a remark made to him by Judd Nelson (also an actor of the so called "brad pack"). So, not sure who's quote this really is...but I use it too....FREQUENTLY ;-)
