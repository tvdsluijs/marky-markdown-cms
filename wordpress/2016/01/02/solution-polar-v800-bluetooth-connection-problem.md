## Comments

**[Rohan](#6475 "2016-08-18 13:05:39"):** Thanks that worked well: I've been pulling my hair out. Any advice on how to pair the heart strap? It stopped working too...

**[Theo van der Sluijs](#6476 "2016-08-18 13:50:20"):** Hi Rohan, Did you remove the heart strap from your phone? At settings? Please remove it and reconnect. I guess this will work! Or! can your phone find the strap? If it cannot the battery may be dead. You can buy a new one in any online shop or offline shop. You don't have to buy the polar one (it's way overpriced)

**[http://gotourl.pw/webs.com](#6901 "2016-08-31 02:29:22"):** This is all kinds of fantastic.Does your advice change at all if you’re not leaving for another job…but rather to start your own business? I’d imagine all these apply, especially the network bit, but would you add anything?

**[Alec](#8148 "2016-09-13 11:16:42"):** thanks for post and procedure. Unfortunately this did not work for me. I may simply have a bluetooth problem on the V800...

**[Xavier](#8159 "2016-09-13 18:08:05"):** Ein-de-lijk... Mijn V800 was gekoppeld tot de update. Dacht dat het een grap was om met uurwerk tegen iPhone te tikken... Hartelijk bedankt! Mvg, Xavier

**[Theo van der Sluijs](#8241 "2016-09-14 10:59:31"):** Hi could you tell me a bit more about the problem you have.

**[Theo van der Sluijs](#8242 "2016-09-14 10:59:58"):** Top! Mooi dat het werkt voor je!!

**[Ana](#9125 "2016-09-23 19:39:52"):** It did not work for me ... :(

**[Theo van der Sluijs](#9126 "2016-09-23 19:46:48"):** Hi Ana what happend, where did it go wrong

**[Ron](#10195 "2016-10-03 17:06:46"):** Worked great. Thanks!

**[Szymon Frydrych](#10326 "2016-10-04 16:20:57"):** Hi I've tried to do your solution but it didn't work. Notifications comes but only if I reconnect phone manually from phone settings menu. Sync data works only when I delete connection in phone and in my v800. Every next trying doesn't work. Problem appeared when I changed phone to iPhone 7

**[Rj](#10619 "2016-10-06 12:52:10"):** I have the same issue as Szymon, I can pair the v800 with my iPhone7+ , and it will sync. Second time around it won't work and it appears to be a Bluetooth connection issue. If I watch on the phone'a Bluetooth settings screen when the watch is trying to pair it flashes between "not connectected" then briefly "connected" then "not connected" and eventually fails. I tried the solution offerred here but it didn't work for me either. I've only had this issue since switching to iPhone7+.

**[gmb](#13433 "2016-11-05 23:32:45"):** thank you, it worked!

**[Manu](#14751 "2016-11-23 23:07:01"):** Hi, I couldn't sync the V800 with my iphone6 anymore. Don't know why. The phone wouldn't detect the polar, so I canceled the polar connection in the bluetooth menu of the phone and canceled the phone in the connected devices. I also restarted the iphone, but as it still didn't work I updated the Polar on the computer. And then miracle it worked again, the iphone detected the V800 and I was able to synch it, without deleting the Flow app. Thanks for the tips.

**[Frank Jensen](#14940 "2016-11-26 07:05:51"):** thank you! Worked perfectly

**[Wynn](#16306 "2016-12-15 18:44:33"):** Thank you very much! I was getting very frustrated. Your solution worked!

**[Theo van der Sluijs](#16307 "2016-12-15 18:49:12"):** Glad I could help!

**[Patrick](#16347 "2016-12-16 10:48:58"):** Perfect - master piece. It worked for me. Thanks @Theo Small addition though: If after step 9 the APP is not asking for to press the lower left button on your watch Step 9A: within the APP go to "more" -> devices -> info -> how to sync? and continue with Step 10
