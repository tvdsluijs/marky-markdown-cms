Hi, first let me welcome you on my Marky-MarkDown CMS bitbucket page!

If you want to see the Marky-MarkDown CMS work go to -> http://itheo.nl/

It's a work in progress, like this CMS so bare with me!

I hope you enjoy this CMS, it's never finished but I will make this CMS work to create a small site or blog.

Keywords of this CMS:
FAST!
THIN!
EASY!

So now let's go to the installation part!

# Step 1:
Go to your site with SSH
Go into the folder where the public_html folder is (do not go into public_html)
Run:
~~~bash
git clone git@bitbucket.org:tvdsluijs/marky-markdown-cms.git .
~~~

If this does not work :-) No worries, I'll get you there
Run the following lines
~~~bash
git init
git remote add origin git@bitbucket.org:tvdsluijs/marky-markdown-cms.git
git fetch
git checkout -t origin/master
~~~

# Step 2
create a config file in the /App folder, there is a example config (config-sample.yml) that you can use and fill
out the following fields:

~~~
debug: False
markdownfolder: /Pages
sitedata:
  sitename: Marky-MarkDown CMS
  sitesubname: Yeah! No More WordPress
  analytics: 1234567
  themename: clean-blog
~~~


To add pages and menu items go to
/App/Pages
Add
01.Home
    item.md
02.Second Page
    item.md
03.Third Page
    item.md

the item.md are the markdown files that contain the page
Menu items will be
